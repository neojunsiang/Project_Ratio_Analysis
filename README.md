# Background Information

As a person who is keen on stocks, I would often read up on the company’s profile and its financials. However, after looking through the different finance pages (i.e. Yahoo Finance, FSMOne and etc.), I have noticed that these websites do not allow me to do a side-by-side comparison. 

In addition, due to the long working hours from my previous job, I didn’t have the time to search and compute the financial ratios of a company, hence, building this app will allow me to just retrieve all the key information with a search on the company that i am keen on and also to do a comparison across all its competitors in the industry

# Solution

Hence, I have decided to create this app whereby it will allow us to do a side-by-side comparison of the important financial ratios for the different companies that I have selected.
